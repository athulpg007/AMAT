AMAT was developed at the Advanced Astodynamics Concepts (AAC) research group at Purdue University. Parts of the AMAT source code were originally developed in support of contracts between AAC and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for various aerocapture mission studies between 2016 and 2020. Samples of atmospheric data from Global Reference Atmospheric Model (GRAM) software is used for illustration purpose only, and was developed by NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. The use of these GRAM models does not imply endorsement by NASA in any way whatsoever. A minimal working set of atmospheric profiles is included with AMAT to run the example notebooks. A minimal working interplanetary trajctory dataset is included with AMAT. The dataset was generated at Purdue University using the STOUR software package by Alec Mudek, and is also derived from trajectories published in the NASA Ice Giants Pre-Decadal Mission Study. The author plans to augment the interplanetary dataset with more publicly available information as it becomes available.

Extras
-------

The AMAT repository includes representative atmospheric profiles for Solar System bodies, an Excel sheet with a comprehensive literature review of aerocapture, sample feasibility charts for aerocapture at all destinations, reference journal articles (by the author), a PDF version of the documentation, and the author's Ph.D. dissertation which provides more details on the methods and algorithms implemented in AMAT.
