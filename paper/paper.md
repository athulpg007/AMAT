# Summary
The Aerocapture Mission Analysis Tool (**AMAT**) is a free and open-source Python package for rapid conceptual design of aerocapture and atmospheric Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) missions in a Jupyter environment. Aerocapture is an orbital transfer maneuver in which a spacecraft uses aerodynamic drag force from a single pass through a planetary atmosphere to decelerate and achieve orbit insertion. Compared to conventional propulsive insertion, aerocapture allows interplanetary spacecraft to accomplish a near-propellantless method of orbit insertion at any planetary destination with a signficant atmosphere. While aerocapture has been studied for many decades, to our knowledge, there are no publicly available tools for rapid conceptual design of aerocapture missions. AMAT aims to fill this gap by providing scientists and mission planners an interactive design tool to quickly evaluate aerocapture mission concepts, perform parametric trade space studies, and select a baseline mission concept for higher-fidelity analysis. Atmospheric Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) includes the hypersonic flight regime where the entry vehicle undergoes intense heating and rapid deceleration, followed by supersonic and subsonic flight, terminal descent phase, and final touchdown. AMAT comes with a suite of tools for rapid end-to-end conceptual design of aerocapture and EDL mission concepts at any atmosphere-bearing Solar System destination.

# Statement of Need

Software tools for identification of trajectories and techniqes that enhance or enable planetary missions or substantially reduce their cost is of great importance in realizing succesful exploration missions within technical, cost, schedule, and risk constraints [@Squyres2011]. While several software tools for conceptual design of EDL missions such as PESST [@otero2010planetary], TRAJ [@allen2005trajectory], and SAPE [@samareh2009multidisciplinary] have been developed in the past, these programs are not publicly available and are not open source. Detailed mission analysis tools such as DSENDS [@balaram2002dsends] and POST [@brauer1977capabilities] are restricted-use codes and are available only to approved persons for U.S. government use. Moreover, detailed high-fidelity analysis such as that performed using POST requires a trajectory expert to setup the simulations. Such high-fidelity analysis is often not required for conceptual design studies. AMAT aims to fill this gap for scientists, engineers, and academic researchers who want to quickly evaluate concepts for atmospheric entry systems as part of mission concept studies.
